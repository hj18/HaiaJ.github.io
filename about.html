              Video games been my passion since I was a child, they helped me
              though many situation. Never thought I'll end up studying computer
              science, as a started my university jouney in Chemical Engineering
              but as time passed I wanted pursue a career in progamming/design
              because that's where my passion is.<br />
              One of my favourite aspects of design is the ability the create
              new environments for players to explore and crafting spaces for
              gameplay and story, all these elements needs to complement each
              other for more enjoyable player experince.<br /><br />
              During university I studied many subjects such as 3D graphics and
              animation, this subject was really enjoyable as I got to design a
              scene in Unreal engine using models I made in Blender. This
              subject enhanced my Blender abilities but I also learned about
              lighting, positing and how it was come together to make a scene to
              tell a story.<br />
              Recently I've been really interested in accessibility in video
              games which lead me to make it the topic of my dissertation. In
              dissertation I focus on settings and ways to help visually
              impaired players play games such as dungeon crawls.

                During my studies I managed to learn many skill, also many which
                I gained alone while joining extra activities such as game
                jams.<br />
                Throughout my time is university I was given the opportnity to
                experiment and try out new software and techniques which lead me
                to gain some experince in using these softwares.<br />
                It is easy for me to adapt to new software as throughout these
                few years since I started I tried out many such as Unity, Souce
                engine, Unreal and many more even with programming languages
                I've used many such as JavaScript, Ocaml, ARM, Java, C++ and
                many more.
